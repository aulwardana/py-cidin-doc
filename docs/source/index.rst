Py-CIDIN (Python-based Collaborative Intrusion Detection Simulation in Integrated Networks)
===================================

**Py-CIDIN** is a Python-based simulator implementing the Stacked Network Integration Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (SNI-CIDS) framework with Modified Ensemble Stacking Deep Neural Networks (MES-DNN) for adaptive intrusion detection in heterogeneous environments. It supports experimentation on collaborative learning across multiple networks and enabling evaluation of model integration and new network onboarding scenarios.
